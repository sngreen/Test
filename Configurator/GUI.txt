Please see the numbers on the images.

Some buttons could probably be excluded or some added, I would not know. 

1.  What does this button mean? Is the naming dynamic?
This is the branch configuration; currently, all the branch configuration and settings can be found here:
https://as-svn001.aeat.allianz.at/svn/alco_conf/configuration_aga/environment/
2.  What does this button mean? Is the naming dynamic?
This are the products supported by this branch, configuration can be found here:
https://as-svn001.aeat.allianz.at/svn/alco_conf/configuration_aga/project/
Lately we started to have just 3 of those
3.  What does this button mean? Is the naming dynamic?
Ignore this button
4.  Where do these values come from?
This values are mostly hardcoded in the application:
the workspace is _always_ created in c:\dev
How we are going to structure it then, it's up to us
5.  Some buttons are grayed out - what do they mean?
    * Release Notes - read or create - where from?
we don't care
    * Technical Documentation, same as above.
we don't care
    * How do the workspaces get managed, just selected? Is it selected by Eclipse?
this would just help to delete unused workspaces - not needed, you can just do it via explorer...
6.  Some buttons are grayed out - what do they mean?
ignore this whole section, we are not using this
    * Windows registry - is this to be updated? With what values? 
    * []
    * Update
    * Setup
7.  Application Launcher
    * How is the availability checked?#
basically there is a check if the application is found along the configured path: e.g.
https://as-svn001.aeat.allianz.at/svn/alco_conf/configuration_aga/application/eclipse4.11.config
-> application\eclipse4.11\modulepath*=C:\ProgramDev\eclipse_2019-03
means: we check if this folder is there, if so, the button becomes active
    * Does it need to be the same number of buttons (expected 5)?
No, this is actually configurable. But actually, there should just one button: "Start Eclipse" as each branch is bound to a dedicated Eclipse version
8.  Application Startup Options - controlled through Windows settings?
    * Minimize AllianzConfigurator after Application Launch
      Here we are talking about threads - will anyone be ever able to maintain it?      
-> we don't care leave it away
    * Automatic Repository Project(s) Import - I think it is done by Eclipse, yes? 
      How is this to be triggered programmatically? 
-> this is something we have to investigate; currently this is done by a self written plugin, just should not even be there, but done every time you start the application
    * Automatic Working Sets Import - what is Working Sets, and how does it get imported? Just copy?
-> same
    * Automatic Targetdefinition Update on Startup - what is it, and how is it done programmatically?
-> happens during startup by a dedicated script, no not needed here
    * Reload Targetplatform on Targetdefinition Changes - in Eclipse?
-> also done with dedicated plugin; there are for sure nicer solutions
9.  I guess here we are looking at threading (from each of the checks) again.
    * How do the violations get separated, and does it come from some Java tool?
    * If yes, how does it get caught?

15. More buttons 
    * AWS
    * Buildreport
    * Buildreport compact
    * Codeboard
    * Improvements
    * Jenkins
    * AzA Adapter Performance
    * Code Adapter Nightly Performance
    * Nexus
    * Q&A
    * Releasetakeover
    * Updatesites
-> not needed!
16. Read in from some configuration file?
exactly, the default settings are defined in the application configuration (e.g. https://as-svn001.aeat.allianz.at/svn/alco_conf/configuration_aga/application/eclipse4.11.config)
here you have then just the possibility to override settings
17. More buttons
    * Set Selected to Default - update file?
    * Set all selected to Default - same as above?
    * Save Options - is not it the same as default? If not, what is the difference?
-> when you don't click there, it is not saved and hence not taken into consideration
18. Where is this read from and when: before the setup or after the setup?
-> this just gives you once more an overview about the values. but actually not needed at all
