Regular expression do not work the same in Git Bash as elsewhere. 
Which environments will people be using Git under;
	Eclipse, Windows, Git Bash, Cygwin, Subsystem, anything they want?
	Where to put scripts, how paths are treated ..
	git rev-parse --git-dir
Merges
	Common ancestors, reachable, determine whether it is a simple commit or if it is a merge.
	
Can not use GitHub Api since we are not talking about the remote, but the local commit




Nothing wrong with good old grep here.

grep -E -o 'finalNumber="[0-9]+"' file.xml | grep -E -o '[0-9]+'
Use -E for extended regular expressions, and -o to print only the matching part.

Pure sed:

sed -n 's/^.*finalNumber="\([[:digit:]]\+\)".*$/\1/p' <test

This might work for you (GNU sed):

sed -r 's/.*finalNumber="([^"]*)".*/\1/' file

Perl does, though:

perl -ne 'print $1 if /(?<=finalNumber=")(.*?)(?=")/'
